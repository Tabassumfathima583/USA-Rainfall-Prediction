## 📌 Objective

To understand rainfall behavior across time and regions in the U.S. using data visualization.  
The aim is to gain insights that assist in **agriculture planning, climate awareness, emergency preparedness,** and **policy decisions**.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

The raw dataset from Kaggle was cleaned using **Python (Pandas)**:
- Removed duplicates and missing values
- Standardized date formats
- Extracted `year`, `month`, `day`, `quarter` columns
- Exported a clean `.csv` for Power BI

🧠 Cleaned using: `data_cleaning.ipynb`
